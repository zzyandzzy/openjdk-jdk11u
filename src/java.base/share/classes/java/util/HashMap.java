/**
 * Hash table based implementation of the {@code Map} interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * {@code null} values and the {@code null} key.  (The {@code HashMap}
 * class is roughly equivalent to {@code Hashtable}, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
 * the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
 * will remain constant over time.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations ({@code get} and {@code put}), assuming the hash function
 * disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
 * collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
 * {@code HashMap} instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
 * of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
 * capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
 * important.
 *
 * <p>An instance of {@code HashMap} has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
 * capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
 * <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
 * get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
 * entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
 * current capacity, the hash table is <i>rehashed</i> (that is, internal data
 * structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately twice the
 * number of buckets.
 *
 * <p>As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good
 * tradeoff between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the
 * space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of
 * the operations of the {@code HashMap} class, including
 * {@code get} and {@code put}).  The expected number of entries in
 * the map and its load factor should be taken into account when
 * setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of
 * rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the
 * maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash
 * operations will ever occur.
 *
 * <p>If many mappings are to be stored in a {@code HashMap}
 * instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow
 * the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using
 * many keys with the same {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow
 * down performance of any hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys
 * are {@link Comparable}, this class may use comparison order among
 * keys to help break ties.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of
 * the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i> be
 * synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 * associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 * structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
 * are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * {@code remove} method, the iterator will throw a
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>

     * Implementation notes.
     *
     * This map usually acts as a binned (bucketed) hash table, but
     * when bins get too large, they are transformed into bins of
     * TreeNodes, each structured similarly to those in
     * java.util.TreeMap. Most methods try to use normal bins, but
     * relay to TreeNode methods when applicable (simply by checking
     * instanceof a node).  Bins of TreeNodes may be traversed and
     * used like any others, but additionally support faster lookup
     * when overpopulated. However, since the vast majority of bins in
     * normal use are not overpopulated, checking for existence of
     * tree bins may be delayed in the course of table methods.
     *
     * Tree bins (i.e., bins whose elements are all TreeNodes) are
     * ordered primarily by hashCode, but in the case of ties, if two
     * elements are of the same "class C implements Comparable<C>",
     * type then their compareTo method is used for ordering. (We
     * conservatively check generic types via reflection to validate
     * this -- see method comparableClassFor).  The added complexity
     * of tree bins is worthwhile in providing worst-case O(log n)
     * operations when keys either have distinct hashes or are
     * orderable, Thus, performance degrades gracefully under
     * accidental or malicious usages in which hashCode() methods
     * return values that are poorly distributed, as well as those in
     * which many keys share a hashCode, so long as they are also
     * Comparable. (If neither of these apply, we may waste about a
     * factor of two in time and space compared to taking no
     * precautions. But the only known cases stem from poor user
     * programming practices that are already so slow that this makes
     * little difference.)
     *
     * Because TreeNodes are about twice the size of regular nodes, we
     * use them only when bins contain enough nodes to warrant use
     * (see TREEIFY_THRESHOLD). And when they become too small (due to
     * removal or resizing) they are converted back to plain bins.  In
     * usages with well-distributed user hashCodes, tree bins are
     * rarely used.  Ideally, under random hashCodes, the frequency of
     * nodes in bins follows a Poisson distribution
     * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with a
     * parameter of about 0.5 on average for the default resizing
     * threshold of 0.75, although with a large variance because of
     * resizing granularity. Ignoring variance, the expected
     * occurrences of list size k are (exp(-0.5) * pow(0.5, k) /
     * factorial(k)). The first values are:
     *
     * 0:    0.60653066
     * 1:    0.30326533
     * 2:    0.07581633
     * 3:    0.01263606
     * 4:    0.00157952
     * 5:    0.00015795
     * 6:    0.00001316
     * 7:    0.00000094
     * 8:    0.00000006
     * more: less than 1 in ten million
     *
     * The root of a tree bin is normally its first node.  However,
     * sometimes (currently only upon Iterator.remove), the root might
     * be elsewhere, but can be recovered following parent links
     * (method TreeNode.root()).
     *
     * All applicable internal methods accept a hash code as an
     * argument (as normally supplied from a public method), allowing
     * them to call each other without recomputing user hashCodes.
     * Most internal methods also accept a "tab" argument, that is
     * normally the current table, but may be a new or old one when
     * resizing or converting.
     *
     * When bin lists are treeified, split, or untreeified, we keep
     * them in the same relative access/traversal order (i.e., field
     * Node.next) to better preserve locality, and to slightly
     * simplify handling of splits and traversals that invoke
     * iterator.remove. When using comparators on insertion, to keep a
     * total ordering (or as close as is required here) across
     * rebalancings, we compare classes and identityHashCodes as
     * tie-breakers.
     *
     * The use and transitions among plain vs tree modes is
     * complicated by the existence of subclass LinkedHashMap. See
     * below for hook methods defined to be invoked upon insertion,
     * removal and access that allow LinkedHashMap internals to
     * otherwise remain independent of these mechanics. (This also
     * requires that a map instance be passed to some utility methods
     * that may create new nodes.)
     *
     * The concurrent-programming-like SSA-based coding style helps
     * avoid aliasing errors amid all of the twisty pointer operations.

     * The default initial capacity - MUST be a power of two.
     * 默认初始化大小为什么定义为2的幂？
     * 我们知道HashMap的底层数据结构是数组+链表/数组+红黑树，由以上方法，可以发现数组下标索引的定位公式是：
     * i = (n - 1) & hash，当初始化大小n是2的倍数时，(n - 1) & hash等价于n % hash。比如：
     * n = 16，hash = 1010，则(n - 1) & hash = 1111 & 1010 = 1010 = 6
     * n = 16，hash = 1010，则n % hash = 1111 % 1010 = 1010 = 6
     * 定位下标一般用取余法，为什么这里不用取余呢？
     * 因为，与运算（&）比取余（%）运算效率高
     * 求余运算： a % b就相当与a-(a / b)*b 的运算。
     * 与运算： 一个指令就搞定
     * 因此，默认初始化大定义为2的幂，就是为了使用更高效的与运算。
     * <p>
     * HashMap默认初始化大小为什么是`1 << 4(16)`?
     * 如果太小，4或者8，扩容比较频繁；如果太大，32或者64甚至太大，又占用内存空间。
     * 打个比喻，假设你开了个情侣咖啡厅，平时一般都是7,8对情侣来喝咖啡，高峰也就10对。
     * 那么，你是不是设置8个桌子就好啦，如果人来得多再考虑加桌子。
     * 如果设置4桌，那么就经常座位不够要加桌子，如果设置10桌或者更多，那么肯定占地方嘛。

     * 如果是1，就是说哈希表完全填满才开始扩容，这样虽然空间利用提高了，但是哈希冲突机会却大了。可以看一下源码文档的解释：
     * 作为一般规则，默认负载因子（0.75）在时间和空间成本上提供了良好的权衡。
     * 负载因子数值越大，空间开销越低，但是会提高查找成本（体现在大多数的HashMap类的操作，包括get和put）。
     * 设置初始大小时，应该考虑预计的entry数在map及其负载系数，并且尽量减少rehash操作的次数。如果初始容量大于最大条目数除以负载因子，rehash操作将不会发生。

         * 使之重新成为一棵红黑树。详细描述如下：
         * 第一步：将红黑树当作一颗二叉查找树，将节点删除。
         *     这和"删除常规二叉查找树中删除节点的方法是一样的"。分3种情况：
         *         ① 被删除节点没有儿子，即为叶节点。那么，直接将该节点删除就OK了。
         *         ② 被删除节点只有一个儿子。那么，直接删除该节点，并用该节点的唯一子节点顶替它的位置。
         *         ③ 被删除节点有两个儿子。
         *             那么，先找出它的后继节点；然后把“它的后继节点的内容”复制给“该节点的内容”；
         *             之后，删除“它的后继节点”。在这里，后继节点相当于替身，在将后继节点的内容复制给"被删除节点"之后，再将后继节点删除。
         *             这样就巧妙的将问题转换为"删除后继节点"的情况了，下面就考虑后继节点。
         *             在"被删除节点"有两个非空子节点的情况下，它的后继节点不可能是双子非空。
         *             既然"后继节点"不可能双子都非空，就意味着"该节点的后继节点"要么没有儿子，要么只有一个儿子。
         *             若没有儿子，则按"情况① "进行处理；若只有一个儿子，则按"情况② "进行处理。
         *
         * 第二步：通过"旋转和重新着色"等一系列来修正该树，使之重新成为一棵红黑树。
         *         因为"第一步"中删除节点之后，可能会违背红黑树的特性。所以需要通过"旋转和重新着色"来修正该树，使之重新成为一棵红黑树。
